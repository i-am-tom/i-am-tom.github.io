I'm Tom. I write code, which _hopefully_ turns out better than my introductions. Fingers crossed.

This blog is going to be a collection of things, the majority probably being articles and tutorials around functional wizardry (I tend to go on about this).

I'd like to say that this pretty website is my doing, but it's actually just a stripped down version of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), which is a magical little Jekyll theme.

Now that this post is out the way, we can get to more interesting things, and I hope we'll talk more soon. I'll try to keep things interesting.

Take care &hearts;
