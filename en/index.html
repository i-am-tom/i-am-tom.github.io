<h1>
  Hello, the Internet
  <small>My name is Tom</small>
</h1>

<section class="homepage-intro">
  I'm a speaker, mentor, and programmer who has written
  <a href="https://github.com/i-am-tom">far too much code</a>. This website is
  about the bits of code that should never have been written.
</section>

<h2>Latest posts</h2>
{% assign filtered_posts = site.posts | where: 'language', page.language %}

<h2>Beef?</h2>

<p>
  Beef is the name of my cat, and he's an extremely good boy. I also happen to
  live in Catalunya, whose official top-level domain is cat. A match made in
  heaven.

<h2>Special thanks</h2>

This website is available in English, Spanish, and Catalan. Two of these are
not languages I speak particularly well yet, so their availability is thanks to
some wonderful friends:

<ul>
  <li>
    David is a polyglot neuroscientist who is frankly far too clever to be
    fixing my Spanish.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://pinksamurai.itch.io/">Uri</a> is a game developer and
    published author who is also far too clever to be doing the Catalan
    translations.
  </li>
</ul>

The hope is that, as I improve, this becomes more of a solo operation. Until
then, if you want an idea of how wonderful and patient these two are, you'll
find my attempts at translating these posts alongside the published versions in
<a href="https://github.com/i-am-tom/i-am-tom.github.io">the website repo</a>.
